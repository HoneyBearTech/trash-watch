# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities in trash-watch through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting form:

https://github.com/HoneyBearTech/trash-watch/security/advisories/new

Do not report vulnerabilities through public issues. Include what you found, how to reproduce it, which
version or commit you tested, and what an attacker gains. Please avoid accessing or changing data that is
not yours while investigating. If you'd like to be credited under a particular name, or not at all, say
so.

## How reports are handled

This is a personal project maintained by one person (see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md)), so these are
targets rather than a contractual SLA:

1. **Acknowledge** the report within 7 days.
2. **Triage** it: reproduce the problem, decide whether it is a vulnerability in trash-watch (see "Scope"
   below) and agree its severity with you. If it isn't a vulnerability, you'll get an explanation, and the
   report may move to a public issue with your agreement.
3. **Fix** it privately in a [GitHub security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories),
   with a regression test where the problem can be tested, and invite you to review the fix if you want
   to.
4. **Release** the fix, then publish the advisory (requesting a CVE where it applies) with the affected
   and fixed versions and any workaround. The aim is to release fixes for critical and high-severity
   issues within 30 days of the report and others within 90 days, and to keep you updated at least every
   14 days until then.
5. **Credit** the reporter in the advisory and the release notes, unless you ask to stay anonymous.

## Coordinated disclosure

Please keep the details private until the advisory is published, or for 90 days after your report if no
fix has been released by then, whichever comes first. If you need a different timeline, say so in the
report.

## Supported versions

The latest release and `main` receive security fixes; a release stops receiving them when the next one is
published. Details are in [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).

## Published vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities fixed in trash-watch are published as
[GitHub security advisories](https://github.com/HoneyBearTech/trash-watch/security/advisories) (with a CVE
where one applies), naming the affected and fixed versions, how to tell whether you're affected and how to
fix or work around it, and they're listed in the release notes and [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). None have
been reported so far.

Known vulnerabilities in what trash-watch is built from (the Python base image, git, PyYAML) are handled as
described in [docs/dependencies.md](docs/dependencies.md).

## Scope

trash-watch is a read-only sidecar: it reads a Recyclarr config directory through a read-only mount,
fetches the public TRaSH Guides repository, and posts notifications to the Discord and ntfy URLs its
operator sets. It opens no ports. What it does and doesn't protect against is described in
[docs/security.md](docs/security.md) (its security requirements), and the reasoning in
[docs/assurance-case.md](docs/assurance-case.md) (threat model, trust boundaries and the defences against
common weaknesses).

In scope: anything that breaks the guarantees in those documents, for example a way to make trash-watch
write to the Recyclarr config or anywhere outside its `data/` directory, to make it send API keys or other
values from the config anywhere, to make crafted guide data or config YAML execute code, a release artifact
that doesn't match its signature, or a published file that leaks a secret. Not vulnerabilities: anything
that needs write access to the host, the `.env` file, the Recyclarr config or the `data/` directory (they
are trusted inputs), and the content of the TRaSH Guides themselves. Vulnerabilities in Recyclarr, Radarr,
Sonarr, Python or git belong with those projects, but please tell us too if trash-watch makes one worse.
